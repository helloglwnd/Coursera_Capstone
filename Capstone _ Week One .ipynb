    "\n",
    "Skateboard industry averages $0.5 bln a year and sales are trending upwards (source -https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/skateboard-market). Skateboards alone are a popular and stable product with high demand, not even mentioning goods related to skateboarding industry (clothing, accessories etc). In my report I'm going to cover the problems that a small business owner faces when trying to open a skateboarding shop in a huge city. So the topic of my research is how to succesfully open a skateboarding store in London, with a little help from data analysis. \n",
    "In my opinion, there are 3 problems that each new skateshop owner would face:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Where?** One of the toughest questions is choosing the right location. Multiple reports (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228637298_The_Impact_of_Retail_Location_on_Retailer_Revenues_An_Empirical_Investigation) show the importance of location for success in retail industry. It's important especially in cities like London where rental and housing prices skyrocket. For skateboarding industry this question is of particular importance, as we need to take into account the most frequently visited locations of target audience (skaters)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **How?** It is crucial to choose what exactly differentiate us from other businesses - understanding the core value proposition for a brand. Given that there is some competition in market and open data available, it's vital to do a research and understand what people don't / do like about the existing players in a location and what we can bring to a table as a new shop\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **What?** Chosing the right product mix. Skaters are particularly picky about brands, one of the risks of retail industry is overstocking with the brands that customers aren't willing to buy. So we need to analyze what is a customer demand for skateboarding brands in a given are and make product decision with strong data fundamentals in place\n",
    "\n",
    "So given that the audience of this report is potential skateboard shop owners, it could be quite beneficial if we could answer those questions with data - this would allow them to avoid costly mistakes and maximize the probability of success. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Data selection for the project.</h4>\n",
    "Now that we have agreed on the problems we'll be solving, let's look at the data available. \n"

    "1. Choosing location <br>\n",
    "Methodology: \n",
    "    - 1.1. One particular problem I need to solve - is locating most frequently visited locations by target audience. What are those? Skateparks of course. Once we get the skatepark data, our goal would be to find locations suitable for a new skateshop as close to these parks as possible. \n",
    "    - 1.2. To find these locations we'll be looking at existing skateshop locations in each London Borough. The goal we have here is somehow decide - does a particular borough have enough skateshops? To solve this problem we need to use of course one of the classification / regression models. We'll fit the model with the existing skateshop data and make a predictions on number of skateshops per Borough. If a predicted number is greater than current amount of skateshops in a borough - that means there is a demand in a new stores. And the opposite, if there are too many skateshops, we need to avoid those Boroughs\n",
    "    - 1.3. Having Skatepark and Skateshop Model data in place we'll need to combine this data to find prospective boroughs as close to existing skateparks as possible. It might be considered as a clusterization problem, or can be solved through calculating some type of distances (like Euclidean). However, given that it's a geo data I'd like to solve it through visualization on a map. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Choosing the differentiation against other skateparks.<br>\n",
    "Methodology:\n",
    "     - 2.1. Find some open data on customer reviews for all skateparks in london and classify them as bad / good reviews\n",
    "     - 2.2. Run a simple semantic analysis (world cloud) to understand what makes a good / bad skateshop\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. Choosing the product mix for a skatepark.<br>\n",
    "Methodology:\n",
    "     - 3.1. Analyze open keyword data on most popular skateboarding brands\n",
    "     - 3.2. Understand which of this brand keywords are trending by looking into user google searches \n",
